Q2. Difference between SQL Injection and Command Injection
A:

SQL Injection: Injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields to access or modify database data.

Command Injection: Injecting system-level commands into applications that execute shell commands.
→ Prevention: Use parameterized queries and avoid unsafe system calls.



---

Q3. How to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?
A:

Use proper input validation and output encoding.

Sanitize user inputs.

Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

Avoid using innerHTML directly in JavaScript.



---

Q4. What causes Broken Access Control and how to fix it?
A: It happens when users can access data or functions they shouldn’t.
→ Fix: Enforce role-based access control, validate permissions server-side, and test with authorization scanners.


---

Q5. Example of Security Misconfiguration
A: Leaving default admin credentials or enabling directory listing.
→ Fix: Disable unnecessary features, update servers, and follow hardening guides.


---

Q6. What is Insecure Deserialization?
A: When untrusted data is deserialized without validation, attackers can execute code or manipulate data.
→ Fix: Validate and sanitize serialized data, use digital signatures for objects.


---

Q7. How can CSRF attacks be prevented?
A: Use CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, and confirm user actions with re-authentication for sensitive operations.


---

Q8. What is Sensitive Data Exposure and prevention?
A: It occurs when confidential data (like passwords or credit card info) is not properly protected.
→ Fix: Use TLS/SSL, encrypt data at rest, avoid logging sensitive info.


---

Q9. What is SSRF and how do you defend against it?
A: Server-Side Request Forgery tricks a server into sending requests to unintended locations.
→ Fix: Validate URLs, restrict internal network access, and whitelist domains.


---

Q10. What are Vulnerable and Outdated Components?
A: Using old versions of frameworks or libraries with known vulnerabilities.
→ Fix: Regularly update dependencies and monitor CVEs.
