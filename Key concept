üîê Key Concepts of DevOps Security

1. Shift Left Approach

Security testing starts early in development rather than after deployment.

Developers use secure coding practices and automated security scans.



2. Automation

Tools automatically check for vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, and configurations.

Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines run SAST, DAST, and SCA scans automatically.



3. Continuous Monitoring

Production systems are monitored for intrusions, misconfigurations, or policy violations.

Security alerts are integrated into CI/CD dashboards.



4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

Cloud infrastructure (Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation) is scanned for insecure configurations.
