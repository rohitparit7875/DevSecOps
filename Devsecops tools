⚙️ Example DevSecOps Workflow

1. Code Commit → Developer pushes code to Git.


2. CI Build → Runs unit tests + SAST + SCA scans.


3. Container Build → Docker image scanned for vulnerabilities.


4. Deploy (CD) → IaC templates validated; secrets retrieved securely.


5. Monitor → Runtime security tools monitor logs, metrics, and alerts.
