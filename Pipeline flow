⚙️ Pipeline Flow:

1. Code Commit
→ Developer pushes code to GitHub/GitLab.


2. Trigger CI Pipeline
→ Jenkins/GitHub Actions triggers build automatically.


3. Build & Unit Test Stage
→ Compile and run automated unit tests.


4. Static Analysis (SAST)
→ SonarQube or Semgrep checks for:

Code quality issues

Security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, hardcoded secrets)



5. Dependency Scan
→ Trivy scans libraries and Docker images for known CVEs.


6. Dynamic Analysis (DAST)
→ OWASP ZAP simulates real-world attacks on the test environment.


7. Quality Gate Enforcement
→ Build fails if critical vulnerabilities are detected.


8. Artifact Deployment (CD)
→ Secure build is pushed to Docker registry and deployed to Kubernetes or staging server.


9. Notification & Reports
→ Jenkins emails or Slack messages summarize vulnerability findings.
