Why is Cybersecurity is Important?
Cyber Security is important because the government, corporations, and medical organizations, collect military, financial, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on a computer and other properties like personal information, and this private information exposure could have negative consequences. 

In 1972, when the internet was just starting (called ARPANET at the time), a test virus named Creeper was createdâ€”and then another program called Reaper was made to remove it. This early experiment showed why digital security was needed and helped start what we now call cybersecurity.

Rising Cyber Threats: How Hackers Exploit Weak Security
Cybercriminals constantly look for ways to exploit weaknesses in systems, networks, and personal devices. Weak passwords, outdated software, and unsecured networks give them easy access. They use advanced tactics like phishing, ransomware, and social engineering to steal data, disrupt systems, or demand money.

With AI-driven threats, even bots can breach security, making cybersecurity more important than ever.

Example: While shopping online, we often save details like email, address, and card info for convenience. Later, we might receive a fake email claiming a special offer from a well-known site like Flipkart or Amazon. When we enter our saved details to claim the offer, hackers can steal that data and misuse it, causing financial loss.

Consequences of Cyber Attacks for Businesses & Individuals
A successful cyber attack can have devastating effects, both financially and reputationally. For businesses, a data breach can lead to massive financial losses, legal penalties, and loss of customer trust. Small businesses are especially vulnerable, as they often lack robust security measures. Individuals, on the other hand, face risks like identity theft, financial fraud, and personal data leaks.

Cyber attacks can wipe out bank accounts, expose private information, and even lock users out of their own devices unless a ransom is paid. The consequences can be long-lasting, leading to emotional distress and financial instability.
