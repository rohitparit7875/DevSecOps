DevOps Security (also called DevSecOps) is the practice of integrating security into every stage of the DevOps lifecycle â€” from planning and coding to deployment and monitoring.
Instead of treating security as the final step, DevSecOps makes it a shared responsibility among developers, operations, and security teams.
