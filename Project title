ðŸ§© Project Overview:

This project demonstrates how to integrate security practices within a DevOps pipeline, ensuring that vulnerabilities are caught early during development â€” not after deployment.
Youâ€™ll build a CI/CD pipeline that automatically scans code, dependencies, and container images before deployment to production.
