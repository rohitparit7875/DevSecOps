Types of Cybersecurity
There are seven types of cyber security, each explained below in detail with uses and functions:

1. Network Security
It focuses on securing computer networks from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other network-based threats. This involves implementing technologies such as Firewalls, Intrusion detection systems (IDS), Virtual private networks (VPNs), and Network segmentation as well as deploying antivirus software

Using public Wi-Fi in locations like cafes and malls poses significant security risks. Malicious actors on the same network can potentially intercept your online activity, including sensitive information. If you use payment gateways on these unsecured networks, your financial data could be compromised because these open networks don’t have proper security layers, which means anyone—even hackers—can watch what you're doing online.
So, use a secure private network or VPN to protect your internal network from outside threats
2. Application Security
Concerned with securing software applications and preventing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. It involves secure coding practices, regular software updates and patches, and application-level firewalls.

Most of the Apps that we use on our cell phones are Secured and work under the rules and regulations of the Google Play Store.
There are 3.553 million applications in Google Play, Apple App Store has 1.642 million, and Amazon App Store has 483 million available for users to download. With so many choices, it’s easy to assume all apps are safe—but that’s not true.
Some apps pretend to be secure, but once installed, they collect personal data and secretly share it with third-party companies.
The app must be installed from a trustworthy platform, not from some 3rd party website in the form of an APK (Android Application Package).
3. Information or Data Security
Focuses on protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. It includes Encryption, Access controls, Data classification, and Data loss prevention (DLP) measures.

Incident response refers to the process of detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents promptly.
Promoting security awareness among users is essential for maintaining information security. It involves educating individuals about common security risks, best practices for handling sensitive information, and how to identify and respond to potential threats like phishing attacks or social engineering attempts.
Encryption is the process of converting information into an unreadable format (ciphertext) to protect it from unauthorized access.
4. Cloud Security
It involves securing data, applications, and infrastructure hosted on cloud platforms, and ensuring appropriate access controls, data protection, and compliance. It uses various cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc., to ensure security against multiple threats.

Cloud-based data storage has become a popular option over the last decade. It enhances privacy if configured and managed correctly and saves data on the cloud, making it accessible from any device with proper authentication.
These platforms offer free tiers for limited usage, and users must pay for additional storage or services
It is a cloud service provider that offers a wide range of services, including storage, computing, and security tools.
5. Endpoint Security
Refers to securing individual devices such as computers, laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices. It includes antivirus software, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), device encryption, and regular software updates.

Antivirus and Anti-malware software that scans and detects malicious software, such as Viruses, Worms, Trojans, and Ransomware. These tools identify and eliminate or quarantine malicious files, protecting the endpoint and the network from potential harm.
Firewalls are essential components of endpoint security. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, filtering out potentially malicious data packets.
Keeping software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches and updates is crucial for endpoint security.
