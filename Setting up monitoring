🧰 Step 1 — Verify Snort Installation

Check Snort version:

snort -V

If not installed, install it (Debian/Ubuntu example):

sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort -y

During installation, it may ask for your network interface (example: eth0).


---

📁 Step 2 — Find Snort Configuration and Rules

Default locations:

Config: /etc/snort/snort.conf
Rules:  /etc/snort/rules/
Logs:   /var/log/snort/


---

🧾 Step 3 — Create or Edit Local Rules

Create or open your local rules file:

sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

Example rule:

alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

Save & exit → (Ctrl + O, Enter, Ctrl + X)


---

⚙️ Step 4 — Make Sure Local Rules Are Loaded

Open main Snort config:

sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf

Check this line exists (uncomment if needed):

include $RULE_PATH/local.rules


---

🧪 Step 5 — Test Configuration

Before starting monitoring:

sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

✅ Output should say:
Snort successfully validated the configuration!


---

🖥️ Step 6 — Start Snort in Monitoring Mode

Now start Snort as a live Intrusion Detection System:

sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

Explanation:

-A console → show alerts on screen

-q → quiet mode (less verbose)

-c → path to config file

-i → network interface (replace eth0 if needed)


To find your interface:

ip link show


---

📦 Step 7 — Background Logging Mode (Continuous Monitoring)

If you want Snort to run quietly and log alerts to files:

sudo snort -A fast -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0 -D

Explanation:

-A fast → logs alerts in fast mode (alert file)

-D → daemon mode (runs in background)



---

📂 Step 8 — Check Logs

View recent alerts:

sudo cat /var/log/snort/alert

For continuous monitoring:

sudo tail -f /var/log/snort/alert


---

🧲 Step 9 — Generate Some Traffic (for testing)

Ping another system or any public IP:

ping 8.8.8.8

Snort should detect it and log:

[**] [1:1000001:1] ICMP Ping Detected [**]


---

🛠️ Step 10 — Optional: Auto-Start Snort on Boot

Create a systemd service (for continuous monitoring on reboot):

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/snort.service

Paste this:

[Unit]
Description=Snort IDS
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/snort -A fast -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0 -D
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Enable and start it:

sudo systemctl enable snort
sudo systemctl start snort
sudo systemctl status snort
