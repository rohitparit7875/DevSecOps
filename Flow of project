ðŸ”„ Pipeline Flow:

1. Developer commits code to GitHub.


2. Jenkins (or GitHub Actions) automatically triggers the CI/CD pipeline.


3. Build Stage:

Code is pulled and built into a Docker image.



4. Security Stage:

SAST: SonarQube scans for code vulnerabilities.

SCA: OWASP Dependency-Check or Trivy scans for dependency issues.

Container Scan: Trivy scans the Docker image for CVEs.

IaC Scan: Checkov scans Terraform/Kubernetes YAML for misconfigurations.



5. Test Stage:

Unit and integration tests run automatically.



6. Deploy Stage:

If all checks pass, the image is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.



7. Monitoring Stage:

Prometheus monitors application metrics and Grafana visualizes them.
