Attack Type	What It Means
Phishing	Phishing is a cyber attack where hackers trick users into revealing sensitive data like passwords, banking details, or session tokens through fake emails, messages, or websites. It uses social engineering to impersonate trusted sources and often includes malicious links or attachments to steal information.
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)	Hackers flood a website or server with too much traffic, so it slows down or crashes. Itâ€™s like a traffic jam that blocks real users from getting in.
