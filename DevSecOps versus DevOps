In traditional software development, projects are split into distinct phases for planning, design, development, integration, and testing, which happen sequentially over several months or even years. Although this approach is very methodical, many organizations have found it to be too slow, making it difficult to meet customersâ€™ expectations for continuous product improvements. Additionally, security typically gets bolted on at the very end, which puts companies at risk of a breach.

To remain competitive, many companies have adopted a DevOps model that prioritizes delivery of smaller packets of high-quality code rather than feature-rich projects that take longer. In this framework, software development and operations teams collaborate to incorporate testing and integration throughout the process. Automation, standardized processes, and collaboration help teams move quickly without sacrificing quality.

DevSecOps is an enhancement to DevOps that builds security into all aspects of the process. The goal is to address security issues from the very start of the project. In this framework, not only does the entire team take responsibility for quality assurance and code integration but also security. In practice, this means teams discuss security implications during planning and begin testing for security issues in development environments, rather than waiting until the end. Another name for this approach is shift left security.
