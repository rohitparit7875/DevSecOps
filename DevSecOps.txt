DevSecOps (Development, Security, and Operations) is a practice that integrates security into every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that security is not an afterthought but a continuous, automated part of development and deployment processes.

üîê Key Features of DevSecOps:
Shift-left security: Security checks start early in the development phase.

Automation: Integrates tools for code scanning, vulnerability assessment, and compliance into CI/CD pipelines.

Collaboration: Encourages strong cooperation between development, security, and operations teams.

Faster delivery: Delivers secure applications without slowing down deployment cycles.

‚úÖ DevSecOps Tools (Examples):
CI/CD: Jenkins, GitLab CI

Security: OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, Trivy, Snyk

Container Security: Docker Bench, Clair, Anchore

Monitoring: ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana

üéØ Goal:
To build secure, reliable, and compliant software faster and more efficiently by embedding security practices from the start.
