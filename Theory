DevSecOps stands for Development, Security, and Operations.
It integrates security practices into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) — from design, development, testing, deployment to operations.

It’s an evolution of DevOps, ensuring that security is not an afterthought, but a continuous process.
